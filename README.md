# Pong Game

This is a simple, yet fully-featured Pong game developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows for two players to compete against each other, bouncing the ball back and forth. The game keeps track of each player's score, increasing the speed of the ball each time it hits a paddle. The game ends when a player scores 5 points, and it offers a "Play Again" option to restart the game. Both keyboard and touch inputs are supported, making the game playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
